                    <hr>
                    <p>I am a <b>Mathematics</b> student who always gets fascinated by observing 
                        application of mathematics in real world. Whether it is the golden ratio, 
                        in which body parts are build or whether it is an algorithm which 
                        is capable to tell us approximately correct answer to every question which is available.
                        <br><br>
                        I started my journey of <b>Data Science</b> by taking specialization courses on coursera. 
                        These specializations helped me to gain in depth knowledge of different <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b>
                        techniques. Today I am able to understand and implement many state-of-the-art ML models
                        which can performs tasks related to <b>Computer Vision</b> or <b>Natural Language Processing</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        After taking these specialization courses I wanted to build something 
                        on my own to test what I learned till then. That's how I get started at Kaggle and 
                        today I am a <b>Kaggle Expert</b> in the notebooks Domian. On Kaggle I learnt that
                        Machine Learning is not just <code>model.fit()</code> and <code>model.predict()</code> it is the whole 
                        process that <b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b> which help us to gain insights about the data 
                        and help to build a high performance model.

              Computer Science and Engineering in one of the top five NIT's that is MNNIT 
              Allahabad. But after a one year in this course I realised that this is not what

              to pursue my interest in Mathematics.

              In this project I developed a classifier which can predict the weather 
              represented in a input image. I scored 3rd rank in this competition's private

            <h2>Paddy Disease Classification</h2>
            <p>This was a kaggle competition in which we were supposed to 
              develop a classifier which can predict the disease which is present in the 
              paddy crop. This project was focused to help farmers identify the diseases 
              accurately so, that they can act accordingly to save their crops.

              <p>I took Deep Learning Specialization from coursera and this was also taught 
                by Andrew Ng sir. This topic was very easy to understand and I get a feel
                of the working of this computer vision application. So, 
                I implemented this by myself by taking help from the learning material provided in the 
                coursework and images taken from google. This was a fun project just to see my learning in applications.

                platform. In this competition, competitors was supposed to build a image 
                segmentation model which can seperate stomach, small and large bowels from the cancerous 
                cells. I didn't completed this project but yes I learned a lot from this project. Different format of image 
                given and the mask has made this competition a learning experience for me.

              In this project I developed a classifier which can predict favourite 
              political party of a family based on some features related to  
              some features regarding physical, financial and educational background of the family.
              I scored 60th rank in this competition's private leaderboard out of approximately around 150 students.

              usage of a building is anomalous or not. This project was focused to help 
              identify the anomalous energy usage in the and rectify the problem so,
              that energy can be saved which is being wasted due to anomalous usage.

            <h2>Autism Prediction</h2>
            <p>In this kaggle project I build a classifier which can 
              predict whether a person has Autism or not by using some input 
              features based on family history and person's background. I secured 9th
              rank out of 120 competitors.

            <h2>Spaceship Titanic</h2>
            <p>A person who is learning Machine Learning has done Titanic 
              in their start of their learning. But I am showing this on my portfolio 
              because this was something different. This dataset contains null values for the imputation of 
              those values I used very different and educative approach which is liked by 
              the sommunity as well. Do check it out.
